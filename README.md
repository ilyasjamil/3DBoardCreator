# What's New
* We have new features such as adding large scale features to the grid. The App will be deployed soon.

# Known bugs
There is a small bug users should be aware of. If users want to add a feature and select multiple tiles, it won't allow them. We did this to avoid overlaps
and to make sure that all of tiles are within the grid. Therefore, users have to select at a time. This is not necessarily a bug but some users may want
to select multiple tiles to add a feature but our app won't allow them to do so.
